# Kaprekar's Routine
The number 6147 is a special number and is known as Kaprekar's constant. If the digits are sorted in increasing order
and subtracted from the digits sorted in decreasing order, you will get 6147 (7641-1467). This is true for any 4 digit number, including ones with leading zeros. If this process is repeated, eventually the difference between the two numbers will result in Kaprekar's constant. This is known as Kaprekar's routine. If the 4 digits are the same, i.e. 2222, then the difference will return a 0.

I have a program in both a py script and jupyter notebook where I programmed this routine to work on a user input 4 digit integer.
